# freepbx-ci-actions
FreePBX CI GitHub Actions.

Starting in 2026, FreePBX will begin using GitHub Actions to trigger multiple processes, initially including **language translations via Weblate**, and potentially soon:
* code linting
* unit testing
* security scanning
* PR verifying
* cherry picking
...and other basic quality assurance and automatable management tasks.
